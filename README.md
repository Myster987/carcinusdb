# CarcinusDB

I'm not sure if this project will be finished soon, because I'm trying so many        \
new things and this approach doesn't align very well with overall state of project.   \
But it's built just to learn.

With current implementation I learned a ton of usefull information. RAII is such      \
a powerful tool in Rust. When you slow down and take your time designing clean,       \
composable and easy to use software you can make some amazing things. Remember:       \
"Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast". This works especially well with languages       \
like Rust, where you need to built solid foundations in order to progress further.
